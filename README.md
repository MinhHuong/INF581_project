# INF581_project

gameUI.py is used for graphic surface only.

main.py should be used for algorithms testing.

Code refactored:

- new class Agent, where we implement the reinforcement algorithms, in agent.py

- enum class Action that represents action space is also moved in agent.py

- create new agent before create new environment

- images used for graphical interface are moved in folder /img
